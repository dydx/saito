      Saito can help other cryptocurrencies and smart-contract platforms scale.
      <p></p>
      It can run payment channels and clusters for non-Saito tokens directly on-chain. Instead of using unstable and centralized second-layer networks, Bitcoin and Ethereum users can exchange cryptographic signatures directly on the Saito network.
      <p></p>
      This scaling solution will be more powerful than second-tier methods like the Lightning Network. Saito-powered channels can support an arbitrary number of members, they can process deposits and withdrawals without closing channels, they do not force users to pay transaction fees, and they do not require participants to be continuously online. Depending on the use case, channels can also be created that support features like instant-withdrawals without the need for a dispute period. And upgrading is easier too: Saito-powered channels can be upgraded in real-time without the need for a network hardfork.
      <p></p>
      To see a working demonstration of this technology, feel welcome to play around with the "EthLN" module (Ethereum Lightning Network) in our default Email Client: just send an EthLN message to someone and they will receive an email invitation to open a payment channel with you. With that said, please note that this is a DEMO that does not connect to the Ethereum network. It is also ultimately network agnostic: if you would like to see payment channels running on your preferred cryptocurrency and can help with implementation please get in touch. We can get payment channels working for any cryptocurrency that supports basic smart contract functionality.
