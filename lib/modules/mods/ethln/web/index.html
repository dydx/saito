      Saito can help other cryptocurrencies scale.
      <p></p>
      We take the data-intensive routing and let other networks focus on settlement and fraud proofs.
      <p></p>
      Why is this better than second-layer networks like the Lightning Network? Saito-powered payment channels can support an arbitrary number of members, process deposits and withdrawals without closing channels, don't force users to pay transaction fees, and don't require people to be continuously online. Depending on the use case, channels can also be created that support instant-withdrawals. And upgrading doesn't require a network hardfork.
      <p></p>
      To see a working demonstration of this technology, try the "EthLN" module (Ethereum Lightning Network) in our default Email Client: send an EthLN message to someone and they will receive an invitation to open a payment channel. With that said, note that our demo does not connect to the Ethereum network. It is also ultimately network agnostic: if you would like to see payment channels running on your preferred cryptocurrency and can help with implementation please get in touch. We can get payment channels working for any cryptocurrency that supports basic smart contract functionality.
